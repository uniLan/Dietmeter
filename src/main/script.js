Tips for Weight Loss Meal Planning:
Portion Control: Stick to the portion sizes mentioned to keep your calorie intake in check.
Stay Hydrated: Drink at least 8 glasses of water throughout the day. Sometimes thirst is confused with hunger.
Adjust as Needed: If you're more active, you may need additional calories. Consider adding more protein or whole grains.
Limit Added Sugars and Refined Carbs: These can contribute to weight gain and reduce the effectiveness of your weight loss efforts.
Prepare in Advance: Meal prepping can help you stick to your meal plan and avoid reaching for convenient, less healthy options."}
	if (userinput == "What exercises should I do today?" {
		botaddmessage = " Here's a simple and effective routine that you can do at home or at a gym, requiring minimal equipment:

Warm-up (5-10 minutes)
Marching on the spot: 2 minutes
Arm circles: 30 seconds each direction
Leg swings: 30 seconds each leg
Dynamic stretches (e.g., lunges with a twist): 2 minutes
Aerobic Exercise (15-20 minutes)
Brisk walking or light jogging: If you're at home without a treadmill, consider walking or jogging in place, stepping side to side, or following a beginner's cardio workout video online. Aim for a continuous, moderate pace where you can talk but not sing.
Strength Training (15-20 minutes)
Perform each exercise for 30 seconds to 1 minute, followed by 30 seconds of rest. Complete two rounds of the following circuit:

Bodyweight squats: Focus on form, keeping your chest up and knees behind your toes.
Push-ups: Beginners can start with wall push-ups or knee push-ups.
Planks: Start with a 20-30 second hold, aiming to keep a straight line from head to heels.
Lunges: Alternate legs, stepping forward and bending both knees to about 90 degrees.
Glute bridges: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor, then lift your hips towards the ceiling.
Flexibility and Cool Down (5-10 minutes)
Hamstring stretch: Sit on the floor with one leg extended, the other bent, and reach towards your toes. Hold for 20-30 seconds each leg.
Quad stretch: Stand and pull one foot towards your glutes, keeping your knees together. Hold onto a wall or chair for balance. 20-30 seconds each leg.
Arm across chest stretch: Pull one arm across your chest with the other, stretching the shoulder. 20-30 seconds each arm.
Deep breathing and relaxation: Spend a few minutes doing deep abdominal breathing to relax and cool down.
Tips for Success:
Stay hydrated: Drink water before, during, and after your workout.
Listen to your body: If something hurts, stop and rest. It's important to push yourself, but not to the point of pain.
Be consistent: Aim to do this workout 2-3 times a week, with rest or light activity days in between.
Progress gradually: As you get stronger and more comfortable with the exercises, increase the duration, add more rounds to your circuit, or include new exercises.
Remember, the goal is to build a habit of regular physical activity, so find exercises that you enjoy and that fit into your lifestyle."}
	if (userinput == "I am 200 pounds and 6 feet tall, how many calories should I eat in a day to lose weight?"){
		botaddmessage = "To lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than your TDEE. A deficit of 500-1000 calories/day is a common goal that leads to a safe, sustainable weight loss of about 1-2 pounds per week.

For a moderate deficit: 2122 calories/day

So, to lose weight at a safe and sustainable pace, aim to consume around 2122 calories per day. Remember, these calculations provide an estimate. Adjustments may be necessary based on your progress, how you feel, and other individual factors."}
	if (userinput == "I am 100 pounds and 5 foot 5 inches, what should i eat in a day to gain weight"){
		botaddmessage = "Gaining weight in a healthy way involves consuming more calories than you burn while focusing on nutrient-rich foods to ensure you're also meeting your nutritional needs. Since you're aiming to gain weight, let's outline a meal plan that not only increases your calorie intake but also includes a balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, along with vitamins and minerals essential for overall health.

Given your current weight and height, your goal is to create a caloric surplus. However, the exact number of calories you need depends on your age, gender, and level of physical activity. On average, adding an additional 300-500 calories per day above your maintenance calories can help you gain weight gradually and healthily. It's important to increase your portion sizes and eat more frequently throughout the day.

Here's a sample meal plan designed to promote weight gain:

Breakfast
Omelette: 3 eggs with spinach, mushrooms, and cheese.
Whole grain toast: 2 slices with avocado spread.
Greek yogurt: Full-fat, mixed with honey and granola.
Mid-Morning Snack
Smoothie: Blend 1 banana, a scoop of protein powder, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter, a handful of oats, and whole milk or a milk alternative for extra calories.
Lunch
Quinoa Salad: 1 cup cooked quinoa with grilled chicken breast, mixed greens, feta cheese, olives, and a drizzle of olive oil and lemon juice.
Fruit: 1 apple or a serving of grapes.
Afternoon Snack
Trail Mix: A handful of mixed nuts and dried fruits.
Cheese and Crackers: Whole grain crackers with slices of cheese.
Dinner
Salmon: Grilled or baked salmon fillet with a teriyaki or honey mustard glaze.
Sweet Potato: 1 large, roasted or mashed with a pat of butter.
Steamed Vegetables: Broccoli and carrots with olive oil drizzled on top.
Evening Snack
Cottage Cheese: Full-fat, mixed with almond slices and a bit of honey.
Dark Chocolate: A few squares for a treat.
Tips for Weight Gain:
Choose nutrient-dense foods: Focus on whole foods that provide vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, along with calories.
Incorporate healthy fats: Avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil are excellent sources of healthy fats that can increase your calorie intake without consuming large amounts of food.
Eat more frequently: Have snacks between meals to increase your overall calorie intake.
Drink your calories: Consider adding smoothies or shakes as they can be a high-calorie, nutritious addition to your diet.
Exercise: Incorporating strength training into your routine can help you build muscle mass instead of just gaining fat.
Remember, gaining weight should be a gradual process. Focus on consistent, healthy eating habits and consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian for personalized advice and to ensure your meal plan meets all your nutritional needs."}
	if (userinput == "How can I eat healthily on a budget?"){
		botaddmessage = "-Meal Planning: Plan your meals for the week to avoid buying unnecessary items and stick to a shopping list based on those plans.
-Smart Shopping: Opt for generic brands, take advantage of sales and coupons, and consider buying in bulk to save money. Choose whole foods over processed items, and buy seasonal or frozen produce to get more value for your money.
-Home Cooking: Prepare meals at home to control ingredients and costs. Cook in batches to save time and money, and be creative with leftovers to minimize waste.
-Limit Meat Consumption: Reduce meat portions and incorporate plant-based proteins like beans and lentils, which are cheaper and nutritious alternatives.

-Reduce Waste: Store food properly to extend its life and find uses for food scraps, such as making vegetable stock from peels.
-Drink Water: Opt for tap water instead of bottled drinks to save money and reduce environmental impact."}
